My dear brothers and sisters, <br/>
**take note** of this:

Everyone should be **quick to listen**, <br/>
**slow to speak** and **slow to become angry**,

[20](# "ref")
because **human anger** does not produce <br/>
the **righteousness** that **God** desires.

[James 1:19-20 (NIV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

---
[21](# "ref")
Therefore, get rid of all **moral filth** <br/>
and the **evil** that is so prevalent

and **humbly accept** <br>
the word **planted** in you, <br/>
which can **save** you.

[James 1:21 (NIV) (p.2/4)](# "ref")

---
[22](# "ref")
Do not merely **listen** to the word, <br/>
and so **deceive** yourselves. **Do** what it says.

[23](# "ref")
Anyone who **listens** to the word <br/>
but does not **do** what it says

is like someone who looks at his **face** in a mirror <br/>
[24](# "ref")
and, after **looking** at himself, goes away <br/>
and immediately **forgets** what he looks like.

[James 1:22-24 (NIV) (p.3/4)](# "ref")

---
[25](# "ref")
But whoever **looks intently** <br/>
into the **perfect law** that gives **freedom**,

and **continues** in it — <br/>
not **forgetting** what they have heard, <br/>
but **doing** it —

they will be **blessed** in what they **do**.
