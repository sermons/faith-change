## James 1:19-20 <small>(NIV) (p.1/4)</small>
<span class="hl2">19</span>
My dear brothers and sisters, <br/>
**take note** of this: <br/>
Everyone should be **quick to listen**, <br/>
**slow to speak** and **slow to become angry**,

<span class="hl2">20</span>
because **human anger** does not produce <br/>
the **righteousness** that **God** desires.

---
## James 1:21 <small>(NIV) (p.2/4)</small>
<span class="hl2">21</span>
Therefore, get rid of all **moral filth** <br/>
and the **evil** that is so prevalent

and **humbly accept** the word **planted** in you, <br/>
which can **save** you.

---
## James 1:22-24 <small>(NIV) (p.3/4)</small>
<span class="hl2">22</span>
Do not merely **listen** to the word, <br/>
and so **deceive** yourselves. **Do** what it says.

<span class="hl2">22</span>
Anyone who **listens** to the word <br/>
but does not **do** what it says

is like someone who looks at his **face** in a mirror <br/>
<span class="hl2">24</span>
and, after **looking** at himself, goes away <br/>
and immediately **forgets** what he looks like.

---
## James 1:25 <small>(NIV) (p.4/4)</small>
<span class="hl2">25</span>
But whoever **looks intently** <br/>
into the **perfect law** that gives **freedom**,

and **continues** in it — <br/>
not **forgetting** what they have heard, <br/>
but **doing** it —

they will be **blessed** in what they **do**.
